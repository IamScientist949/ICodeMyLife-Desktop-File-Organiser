# ICodeMyLife-Desktop-File-Organiser
Hey guys! This code, as always, written by me, is used to organize all your files in the Desktop folder! But some prep will be required (u can see dat in the .txt file!)... hopefully all of you like it find it useful! A share would be much appreciated!


Ok, so basically, first, you hace to make some folders in your desktop called,
"other stuff"
"Videos"
"PSD files"
"Video Editing files"
"Documents"
"Audios"
"Images"


Once this is done, you have to copy and past the code I have written to any downloaded code-writing-program of your choice... you know what I mean lol....
anyways, once that's done, save that .py file as "app!.py" and make sure it is in the Desktop folder, along with the folders you just created...
Thats it! Then, you can run the program and it should work like magic!
